# lstm
Vanilla LSTM implementations.

<b>lstm_dicts.py</b> is an LSTM implementation that just uses numpy, and dictionaries function as the caches.

<b>lstm_class.py</b> Is like lstm_dicts, but implemented as a Python class.

<b>lstm_utils.py</b> are basic functions for use across the different implementations (e.g., batch generation, shuffling, activation functions, etc.)

<b>lstm_multilayer.py</b> Is a pair of funtions, one for individual LSTM layers, and one to implement layers together.
