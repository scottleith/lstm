# lstm
Vanilla LSTM implementations.

<b>LSTM - Numpy and Dictionaries.py</b> is an LSTM implementation that just uses numpy, and dictionaries function as the caches.

<b>LSTM - Class is an LSTM implementation.py</b> using a Python class.

<b>LSTM - Utils.py</b> are basic functions for use across the different implementations (e.g., batch generation, shuffling, activation functions, etc.)

<b>LSTM - Sample Data Generation.py</b> contains a basic method for generating sequences data for testing LSTM using trig functions (sin, cos). However, any function can be used to create sequences.
