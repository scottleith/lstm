# lstm
Vanilla LSTM implementations.

<b>LSTM - Numpy and Dictionaries</b> is an LSTM implementation that just uses numpy, and dictionaries function as the caches.

LSTM - Class is an LSTM implementation using a Python class.

LSTM - Utils are basic functions for use across the different implementations (e.g., batch generation, shuffling, activation functions, etc.)

LSTM - Sample Data Generation contains a basic method for generating sequences data for testing LSTM using trig functions (sin, cos). However, any function can be used to create sequences.
